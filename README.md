# Starshatter-Vanilla-Improvement
Improvements to Vanilla game.

Simple attempt to improve Starshatter vanilla code, fixing some bugs and adding/changing features for better gameplay and fun.
Many of the changes will come directly from the Rearmed mod if it fits vanilla spirit.

This is an exercise for learning coding as much as it is the passion of improving a game I still enjoy.
